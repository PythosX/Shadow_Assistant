# 👻 Shadow Assistant — AI DM Assistant for Content Creators

# https://shadow-assistant.vercel.app

> **Autonomous FAQ automation paired with intelligent human escalation for content creators and public figures.**

Shadow Assistant is an AI-powered DM assistant designed to help creators manage incoming messages more efficiently. Instead of treating every DM as a simple chatbot interaction, Shadow Assistant uses AI reasoning, memory retrieval, and escalation logic to decide how each message should be handled.

The goal is simple: **automate repetitive conversations while keeping important conversations under human control.**

---

## 🚀 The Problem

Content creators, founders, and public figures can receive hundreds of DMs every day.

Many messages are repetitive:

- Product or gear questions
- Frequently asked questions
- Requests for links
- General feedback
- Routine information requests

But some messages require human attention:

- Business opportunities
- Sponsorship requests
- Media inquiries
- Paid collaborations
- Complex or sensitive questions
- Messages that require the creator's personal judgment

A basic keyword bot can be too rigid, while fully automatic AI replies can be risky for high-value conversations.

**Shadow Assistant is designed to sit between these two approaches.**

## 💡 How Shadow Assistant Works

```text

┌─────────────────────┐
│   AI Understanding  │
│ Intent + Context    │
└─────────┬───────────┘
          │
          ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Memory Retrieval  │
│ Relevant creator    │

└─────────┬───────────┘
          │
          ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Decision Engine   │
└───────┬─────┬───────┘
        │     │

        │         │
        ▼         ▼
   AI Reply   Human Escalation
        │         │
        └────┬────┘
             ▼
        Creator Inbox
```

The important design principle is that Shadow Assistant does **not depend only on exact question formats or keywords**.

The AI first tries to understand the **meaning and intent** of the incoming message, then retrieves relevant information from memory before generating a response.

---

## ✨ Core Features

### 🧠 AI Intent Understanding

Shadow Assistant analyzes the meaning of an incoming message instead of relying only on fixed question patterns.

For example:

> "What camera do you use?"

and

> "Which camera are you shooting with these days?"

can represent the same intent even though the wording is different.

---

### 🔎 Memory Retrieval

Relevant creator information can be stored as reusable memory, allowing the assistant to retrieve facts before generating a response.

Examples:

- Camera and equipment details
- Frequently asked questions
- Social links
- Product information
- Creator preferences
- Standard responses
- Personal knowledge approved for automation

---

### 🤖 Automatic Replies

For routine, low-risk conversations, Shadow Assistant can generate a contextual response using the retrieved information.

The objective is to make the response feel natural rather than like a rigid FAQ bot.

---

### 🚨 Intelligent Escalation

When a message appears important, complex, or unsuitable for automatic handling, Shadow Assistant can escalate it for human attention.

Examples:

- Sponsorship opportunities
- Business proposals
- Media requests
- Paid collaborations
- Unclear high-value messages

The creator remains in control of these conversations.

---

### 📊 Live Dashboard

The dashboard provides an overview of the DM automation system.

Current interface includes:

- Incoming message count
- AI reply count
- Escalation count
- Current automation mode
- Live conversation inbox
- Conversation viewer
- AI decision activity panel
- DM simulation/testing panel

---

## 🖥️ Dashboard

The current Shadow Assistant dashboard contains:

```text
┌──────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│              │                                              │
└──────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The dashboard also includes a **Simulate Incoming DM** area for testing the agent workflow before connecting a real messaging platform.

---

## 🧪 Testing

The current dashboard provides a way to simulate incoming DMs.

Example test messages:

```text
What camera do you use?

Where can I find the product you mentioned?

I have a sponsorship opportunity for you.

Can you tell me about your setup?

I want to discuss a business collaboration.
```

These messages can be used to test how Shadow Assistant interprets and routes different types of conversations.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

Shadow Assistant is being developed around an agentic workflow:

```text
             Incoming Message
                    │
                    ▼
             AI Intent Analysis
                    │
                    ▼
             Context Retrieval
                    │
                    ▼
             Creator Memory
                    │
                    ▼
              AI Reasoning
                    │
          ┌─────────┴─────────┐
          ▼                   ▼
    Auto Response       Escalation
          │                   │
          ▼                   ▼
       User DM          Creator Review
```

This architecture allows the system to separate **routine automation** from **high-stakes human decisions**.

## 🧠 Why Shadow Assistant Is Different

Shadow Assistant is not intended to be just another chatbot.

Traditional FAQ bots often depend on predefined keywords or exact question formats.

Shadow Assistant's intended workflow is:

```text
Understand → Retrieve → Reason → Respond / Escalate
```

This allows differently worded messages with the same underlying meaning to access the same relevant knowledge.

At the same time, Shadow Assistant is designed to avoid treating every message as safe for automatic handling.

---

## 🛡️ Human-in-the-Loop

One of the central ideas behind Shadow Assistant is:

> **Automation for routine conversations. Human control for important conversations.**

The AI can handle repetitive questions, while conversations involving business opportunities or other high-value situations can be surfaced to the creator instead of being blindly answered.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

The project is being developed as a lightweight web-based AI application.

Current project direction includes:

- **Frontend:** HTML / CSS / JavaScript
